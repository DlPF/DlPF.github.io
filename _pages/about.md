Welcome and thanks for visiting my site! I'm a student at State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, supervised by [Prof. Xiaogang Jin](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/jin/). I received my Bachelor's degree of Software Engineering form North University of China in 2020. And I expect to receive Master's degree in 2023.

My research interest mainly lies in Traffic simulation and Physical simulation.
